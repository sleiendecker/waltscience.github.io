title: Which states have the most power to elect a president?
---

**Americans don't actually vote for a president.**

Instead, they vote to determine how the actual people who vote for president should vote. If that sounds needlessly complicated, [it is.](https://www.history.com/news/the-history-of-the-electoral-college-debate)

The people that actually elect a president are called electors. All the electors together form the Electoral College. And each state is given a number of electors based on its population size.

**How does the Electoral College affect your power to elect a president?**

 To find out, I calculated the presidential voting power of each state. By dividing the number of presidential ballots cast by the number of electors in each state, I determined the number of ballots per elector. To calculate power, I then divided each states ballots per elector value by the average state ballots per elector.
 
The resulting number is the individual voting power for each state compared to the average person's voting power across all states.

The map shows people in certain states have much more power to elect a president. One vote in Wyoming is about 260% more powerful than the average voter. But one vote in Florida only has 68% the power of an average vote.
