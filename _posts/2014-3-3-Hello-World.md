title: Which states have the most power to elect a president?
---

**Americans don't actually vote for a president.**

Instead, they vote to determine how the actual people who vote for president should vote. If that sounds needlessly complicated, [it is.](https://www.history.com/news/the-history-of-the-electoral-college-debate)

The people that actually elect a president are called electors. And all the electors together form the Electoral College. Each state is given presidential electors based on its population size.
